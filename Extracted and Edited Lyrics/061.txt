(Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover)
(Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover)
(Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover)
I know it hurts
You know
I'd quench that thirst
(I can treat you better than her)
You say you're lonely
I say you think about it
'Cause you're the only
One who resonates that chase
Mouth open like (high)
Higher than a motherfucker dreaming of you as my lover
(Open your heart)
Flying like a streamer, thinking of new ways to do each other
(Open your heart)
Pull out the incisor, give me two weeks you won't recognize her
Mouth open you're high
I know it hurts
You know
I'd put you first
(I can fuck you better than her)
You say you want me
I say you'll live without it
Unless you're the only
One who instigates
Got your mouth, open your heart
Higher than a motherfucker dreaming of you as my lover
(Open your heart)
Flying like a streamer, thinking of new ways to do each other
(Open your heart)
Pull out the incisor, give me two weeks you won't recognize her
Mouth open you're high
Feel your body closing, I can rip it open
Suck me up I'm healing, for the shit you're dealing
Smoke on the skin to get those pretty eyes rolling
My thighs are apart for when you're ready to breathe in
Suck me up I'm healing, for the shit you're dealing
Hi, motherfucker got your mouth open you know you're mine
I'd put you first
Just close your eyes and dream about it
(Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover)
I'll quench your thirst
Just chase the high and stop your doubting
Flying like a streamer, thinking of new ways to do each other
(High, high, high, high)
Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover
Flying like a streamer, thinking of new ways to do each other
(Open your heart)
Pull out the incisor, give me two weeks you won't recognize her
Mouth open you're high
