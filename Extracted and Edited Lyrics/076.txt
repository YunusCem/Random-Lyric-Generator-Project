I'm in my penthouse half naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at
There's just one shot left of this drink
In this glass don't make me break it
Wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise
And I know that I'm not honest
Now you got me yelling
That's because I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Ooo I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Ooo I'm jealous
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this
Take it one step further
Freakum dress out of my closet
Yonce filling out this skirt
I look damn good I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy you been hanging out at night
I'm staying out until tomorrow
Dancing on them tables
Ain't got no cares no sorrows
I ran into my ex
Say what's up to his bestest
Now we reminiscing
How we used to flex in Texas
Don't be jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Ooo I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this, no
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful
But that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Ooo I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
