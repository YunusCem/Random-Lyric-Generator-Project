Let me hear you say "Hey, Ms. Carter!"
(Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Say "Hey, Ms. Carter!"
(Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Give me some!
See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here gotta look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe
Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
(How it's looking babe)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's looking, babe
(How it's looking babe)
And tell me how I looking, babe (looking, babe)
Drop the bass, man, the bass get lower
Radio say, "Speed it up," I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why do you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
Cause when you wanna smash, I just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like like liquor like like like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like like liquor, like like like liquor
Drop!
[Partition]
Driver, roll up the partition, please
Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don't need you seeing Yoncé on her knees
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara runnin', red lipstick smudged
Oh he so horny, yeah he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons and he ripped my blouse
He Monica-Lewinsky'd all on my gown
Whoa there daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby we better slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club
Take all of me

The kinda girl you like (girl you like)
Take all of me

The kinda girl you like is right here with me
Right here with me
Right here with me

Driver, roll up the partition fast
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blastin'
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we'll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping trying not to crash
Oh, there daddy, daddy now you ripped my fur
Oh, baby, baby be sweatin' out my hair
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like)
The kinda girl you like (girl you like)
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me
Right here with me
Right here with me
Right here with me
Hello!
"Do you like sex?
Sex. I mean, the physical activity.
Coitus. Do you like it?
You're not interested in sex?
Men think that feminists hate sex,
But it's a very stimulating and natural activity that women love."]
Take all of me
