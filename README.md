### We would like to thank the following people for their code:

Max Woolf [minimaxir](https://github.com/minimaxir) whose [text generating neural network](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrn) we used.

Michael Phillips [mphilli](https://github.com/mphilli) whose [phonetic alphabet converter](https://github.com/mphilli/English-to-IPA) we modified.

Kemal Burcak Kaplan [kaplanbr](https://github.com/kaplanbr) whose [markov lyric generator](https://github.com/kaplanbr/Serdar-Ortac-Lyrics-Generator) we heavily drew from.

Mohammed Ma'amari whose [LSTM model with Keras](https://towardsdatascience.com/@mamarih1) we also drew from (but did not end up using for the final project).
